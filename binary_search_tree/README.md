# Overview
This directory module is for learning purposes of binary search trees.

# To Run
1. Download it from github
2. Start up a virtual environment
3. Create binary trees using the methods outlines in bst.py
4. Ese the different traversal methods to see binary tree

## Contents

In it you will find methods construct binary search trees, which are data structures which allow you to insert values into them in a sorted manner. You also have different traveseral methods available to you:
* in order
* pre order
* post order
These allow you to got through and see all the values of the tree. Likely most useful if you al starting out is the in order, which allows you to view the structed data in it's desired lowest to highest form.
