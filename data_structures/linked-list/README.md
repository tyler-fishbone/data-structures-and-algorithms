## Overview - Merge Lists
It's lunch and I've decided to sun myself on my favorite rock in Seattle center. A socialized yound squirrel bounds up to me and issues me the following challenge.

## Challenge
'Churrk. Hey you. You there. Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the single list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges. Thanks! Can I have your sandwich?'
