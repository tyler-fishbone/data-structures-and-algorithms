# Insert and shift middle index of list
This is our first whiteboard challenge for this class. We first were to write out a bunch of information and pseudocode about the challenge which you'll see below, then execute it on our own.

## Challenge
Our challenge was to create an algorithm that took in an inputted array and value and at the midpoint (or the rounded up midpoint if the length was an odd number) insert the value into the array, shifting the remainig elements up on in position. We were to do this without using any of the built in methods of python e.g. append, slice, etc... that would have made this a one-liner.
